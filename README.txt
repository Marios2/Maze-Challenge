Maze Challenge

Please execute from tc_Maze_Challenge.py

All maze files are potential inputs containing one maze for each one. Please feel free to check with different mazes, if needed. In case of testing a maze from a different txt file, please enter the name of the file in the array “txt”files of “tc_Maze_Challenge.py”

As a reminder:

Please make sure the mazes are in the appropriate format as shown below (as in the demo txts):

Maze Example:

___XX___XXX(\n)
S__X___X_XG(\n)
__XX_XX____(\n)
X_______XXX(\n)  
{end of file}


Thank you.
